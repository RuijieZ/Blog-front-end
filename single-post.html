                            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I                     you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great  explorer of the truth, the master-                     builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because                       those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is                     there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally                         circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us                     ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find                         fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that                           produces no resultant pleasure?"
